The background-size css property can used to set the size of the background image.

For example, if background-size is set to 100% 100%, then the image will fit and cover the entire height and width of the parent element.

Say, if the background size property was set to 50% 50%, then the background image's height would cover exactly 50 percent of the parent element. This will result in the image repeating to fill the remaining space, in our example it would repeat 4 times.

If you don't want/are against it repeating, then you can use the "background-repeat" property to prevent it from repeating. This can be done by setting the value of the background-size property to one.

The background-origin property can be used to make the image start from the border or from the content, etc.

The background-position property can be used to position the background image within an element, such as a div for example.

Within the background-position property, you can use values like top, center, left, etc to specify the position of the background image. You can also combine the values to further specify the position of the background image, for example, "bottom left" or "top right", "center top", etc.
