This is an example of a simple login form.

Here you can see how an HTML form is created at the gorund level.

The form method used here is "post". The post method is generally considered better compared to the alternative "get" method because, unlike the get method, the post method does not reveal the form data in the URL.

Try changing the value of "method" in the form tag to "get" and submitting the form with some dummy values. You will see that whatever you have entered into the form, even the password will be visible in the URL.
